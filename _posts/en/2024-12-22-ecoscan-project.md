## ðŸš€ Introduction

Ecoscan is a Pfandautomat inspired waste collection mobile application that rewards users for recycling reusable waste like cans and plastic bottles (through a recycling machine) with points that can be exchanged into vouchers. The application is built using Flutter for front-end, Express.js for back-end, and MySQL as database, it includes user, admin, and machine (simulation of what the machine might look like and how it behaves) screens.

This was a college project for software development subject done with a group and was the first time me and my groupmates have ever tried mobile app development. I was in charge of back-end but due to slow progress on front-end, I had to take over on some areas (reason why some screens have differing language).

## ðŸ“¸ Features Preview

For the user screen, it includes a homepage, news screen, QR code scanner, vouchers screen, and profile. Homepage consists of a carousel of news cards, withdrawal history, shortcut to point redeem, and a voucher purchase history. News screen consists of a list of news entries. QR code scanner is used to scan QR codes that gets outputted by the machine after inserting waste, after which you will gain points depending on waste inserted. Vouchers screen is where you can redeem/exchange your points into vouchers. Lastly profile which shows your profile. (There is technically one more screen for support center but I feel like it'd just be too long)

For the machine simulation screen, it includes entries with a dropdown menu filled with waste types (taken from database) and a text area for quantity. After submitting, it will make a QR code with value based on waste type and quantity.

</div>

Lastly, for admin screen. It includes support ticket screen, news (or education) screen, voucher screen, and profile. Like the reason before I wont be showing support ticket screen due to users also not showing it (It'd get confusing).

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 10px;">
