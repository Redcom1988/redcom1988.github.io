## ðŸš€ Introduction

Papikos is a mamikos inspired room listing browser website that includes a report system to prevent fraudulent activities/behavior from room owners, and a built-in chat system (not using websocket but just repeated fetch every few seconds) for easy communication between owners and renters. The website is built using Laravel + React for front-end and back-end with SQLite as database. 

Renters can see, filter, search, bookmark, report, (with image proof) listings, book surveys for selected listings, and also chat with the owner of a selected listing. Owners can do the same but also refute a report in case it was a fake report and cancel/finish booked survey appointments, owners also have a dashboard that shows statistics of their room listings, allows them to create more room listings, and edit/update their listings to their desired result. Lastly admins also have a dashboard that shows all user and room data, and reports that they can review individually to change report status and take action from there.

Website also sends an email every month containing a payment link from doku to behave as a service fee for owners (this was done instead of a proper payment gateway system due to lack of time and manpower). Lastly it includes a login, register, forgot password, and a dark/light mode.

This was a final college project for web development subject done with a group. I was in charge of everything (back-end, front-end, data, devOps, design) due to my groupmates lack of ability.
