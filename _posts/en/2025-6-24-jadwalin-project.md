## ðŸš€ Introduction

**JadwalIn** is a digital class scheduling and room booking system designed to streamline academic operations at the Informatics Study Program, Universitas Udayana. It was built using Laravel and React.js, with SQLite for the database.  

Admins can manage schedules, user roles, room assignments, and handle booking requests. Lecturers and students can view schedules, propose class changes, and request room bookings â€” all in real-time, through a role-based dashboard interface.

This was a final project for the System Information course. I was responsible for the scheduling algorithm using constraint programming and the API implementation
