## 🚀 Introduction

**Payment Gateway Cashier** is a desktop cashier application developed using Python and Tkinter for the UI, and SQLite for the database. It integrates with DokuAPI to provide payment gateway functionality. 

This application was built as a final group project for the Algorithm Analysis and Design course. I was fully responsible for back-end development, including database structure and API integration.
