## ðŸš€ Introduction

Trivium is a trivia application based on OpenTriviaDB. The application is built using kotlin android and jetpack compose for front-end. It features multiple categories and difficulties of questions (all of which are multiple choice) based on the OpenTriviaDB selections.

This was a personal project with my brother where I'm in charge of front-end development and UI/UX, meanwhile my brother is in charge of the back-end development.

After the user presses start game, they get redirected to game menu that shows questions and answers (in the form of option buttons). User can pick an option and confirm to lock their answer after which it will show the correct answer highlighted in green, and the wrong answer (if the selected option is wrong) in red. 

The game will keep track of score, streak, and time spent (which will pause after confirming answer). Give up button is used to stop the game. When the user finishes the game, it will show and end screen that shows score, time spent (slightly bugged at the moment), accuracy, marks (i.e. 2/20), best streak, and achievement progress. After which user can choose to play again or go back to the main menu.
