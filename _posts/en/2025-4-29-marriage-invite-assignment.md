## 🚀 Introduction

Marriage Invitation Website is a digital wedding invitation built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, with Firebase Realtime Database for storing RSVP data.

Firebase is used to store guest registration details such as name, timestamp, message, and attendance confirmation.

This project was a small group assignment for the Web Development course. I was fully responsible for both front-end and back-end implementation, while my teammates handled the UI layout only.
