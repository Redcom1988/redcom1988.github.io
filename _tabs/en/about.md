# About Me

I'm currently a computer science student in Udayana University. Over the years, I've learned a lot from others, whether it's a relative or the online community - people who freely share their experiences, solutions and insights. This site serves as an archive of projects that I've done previously.

Beyond IT, I enjoy learning new stuff, reading manga and playing video games. If any of my posts helped you solve a problem or spark new ideas, then it doesn't really live up to it's description huh.
